## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mansi Bhiwapurkar 


**Graduate Student At California State University,Long Beach - Information Systems** 

Experienced Software Development Engineer with 4 years of work experience - skilled in building and maintaining efficient, scalable, and reliable software systems.

I have been privileged to have academic and professional exposure to multiple technology stacks. During my professional career, I have worked with teams using Java, Salesforce, Springboot, Microservices architecture, Docker, SQL and MongoDb. As a master's student at California state university,Long Beach, I have learned from industry leaders and experienced professors as well as implemented projects using Python, Machine Learning, SQL, NoSQL, SpringBoot, and Apache Kafka. The common denominating factor while facing all these different tech stacks was my intellectual curiosity at problem-solving and having an end-user-defined approach during development.
